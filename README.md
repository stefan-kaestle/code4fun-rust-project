# Gentle practical introduction to Rust

Simple Rust project, incrementally growing. Finally, a web-server (with `actix`) using a mysql database as backend (with `diesel`).

For participants of the Code4Fun, there is still a mysql server up and running (and will be for a while longer):

`echo DATABASE_URL="mysql://rustuser:\%23Code4Fun@130.61.92.85/rustdemo" > .env`

Otherwise, you can also setup your own. The working set can be downloaded from:
